THEME:
Rolling fast down the hall in the midday rush
Office life, paper flight, coffee-scented crush
Hear the wheels, feel them squeal on the vinyl floor
Oh they roll, out of control, who’s chair is this for?

For a chair, workers stare, why? They never know
Spinning ’round, crashing down, pride begins to go
Men of five, still alive as the swivel flows
Gone insane from the strain that their posture knows

For whom the chair rolls
Time marches on
For whom the chair rolls

Take a seat, hold on tight ’cause it might fly
It’s the last time you will
Office roar, chair hardcore, racing ’til they cry
Shattered goals, donut rolls, lunch is flying by

Stranger now are his eyes from velocity
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of floor, chair is poor, wheels in agony
Now they see what will be, rolling endlessly

For whom the chair rolls
Time marches on
For whom the chair rolls
